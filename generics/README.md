## [Getting started with generics](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/generics)

The basics of generics in Go. With generics, you can declare and use functions or types that are written to work with any of a set of types provided by calling code.

We will declare two simple non-generic functions, then capture the same logic in a single generic function.

The progress through the following sections:

- Create a folder for your code.
- Add non-generic functions.
- Add a generic function to handle multiple types.
- Remove type arguments when calling the generic function.
- Declare a type constraint.
